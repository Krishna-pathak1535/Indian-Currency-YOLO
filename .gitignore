# YOLOv5 specific (adjust as needed)
# The 'runs' directory can get very large with training results.
# It's usually better to not upload the entire 'runs' directory,
# but you *do* need the 'best.pt' file.
# So, we'll ignore the whole 'runs' folder, but then explicitly
# NOT ignore the 'weights' subfolder where 'best.pt' is.

# If your best.pt is outside 'runs' or directly in 'yolov5',
# ensure you don't ignore it. For your structure:
!yolov5/runs/
!yolov5/runs/train/
!yolov5/runs/train/*/
